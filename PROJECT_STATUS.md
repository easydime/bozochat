# BozoChat - Project Status

## ✅ COMPLETE - Ready to Use!

I've rebuilt BozoChat from scratch based on your prototype in the `files/` folder, with the architecture you wanted:

### What's New

1. **Electron-based Windows Client** with system tray
2. **Discord bot with attachment support** (not just URLs)
3. **Beautiful overlay notifications** matching your design
4. **One-click .exe installer** for easy distribution to friends
5. **Complete documentation** and setup guides

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
Discord Server
      ↓
   /send command with attachment
      ↓
Discord Bot (Node.js)
      ├─ Downloads media
      ├─ Converts to base64
      └─ Broadcasts via WebSocket
            ↓
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    ↓                 ↓
Client A          Client B    (Electron apps in system tray)
    ↓                 ↓
 Overlay          Overlay     (Beautiful fullscreen notification)
```

### Components

**1. Discord Bot Server (`src/bot/index.js`)**
- Listens for `/send` slash command
- Downloads attached images/videos
- Manages WebSocket connections
- Broadcasts media to all connected clients
- Base64 encodes media for transmission

**2. Electron Client (`src/client/`)**
- Runs in system tray (doesn't show in taskbar)
- Connects to bot server via WebSocket
- Shows overlay when notification received
- Configurable via settings window
- Can auto-start with Windows

**3. Overlay (`src/client/renderer/overlay.html`)**
- Transparent, always-on-top window
- Displays images, GIFs, and videos
- Shows sender name and custom message
- Auto-dismisses after duration
- Click or ESC to close early

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally

**Terminal 1 - Start Bot:**
```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env
# Add your Discord token to .env
start-bot.bat
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Client:**
```bash
start-client-dev.bat
# In settings: ws://localhost:3001
```

**Discord:**
```
/send [upload image] "Hello!" 5
```

### 2. Build Installer for Friends

```bash
build-client.bat
# Share dist/BozoChat Setup 1.0.0.exe
```

### 3. Port Forward (Optional)

If hosting from home and friends are on different networks:
- Forward port 3001 on your router
- Share your public IP
- Friends use `ws://your-public-ip:3001`

---

## Files You Need to Edit

### Before Starting Server

**`.env`** (copy from `.env.example`)
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
PORT=3001
```

### Before Starting Client

Client settings are configured via the GUI:
- Right-click system tray icon → Settings
- No files to edit!

---

## Key Features

✅ **System Tray Integration**
- Runs quietly in background
- Right-click for menu
- Shows connection status

✅ **Beautiful Overlays**
- Modern Discord-style design
- Smooth animations
- Supports images, GIFs, videos

✅ **Easy Distribution**
- Build once, share installer
- Friends just double-click
- No technical knowledge needed

✅ **Reliable Connection**
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Periodic ping/pong
- Connection status indicator

✅ **Customizable**
- Overlay position (5 presets)
- Display duration
- Auto-start with Windows
- User identification

## Differences from Prototype

### What Changed

| Old Prototype | New Version |
|---------------|-------------|
| Python client | Electron (JavaScript) |
| URL-based media | Attachment support |
| Manual file handling | Automatic base64 encoding |
| Basic overlay | Beautiful Discord-style UI |
| No installer | NSIS installer |
| Manual config files | GUI settings window |

### What Stayed the Same

- WebSocket communication
- Discord bot architecture
- Overlay concept
- System tray approach
- General workflow

---

## Important Notes

### Icon File

The current `src/client/icon.png` is a placeholder. For production:

1. Create a proper 256x256 PNG icon
2. Convert to .ico format
3. Save as `build/icon.ico`
4. Rebuild with `build-client.bat`

### Security

⚠️ This is designed for **private use with trusted friends**

- No authentication built in
- Anyone connected receives ALL notifications
- Consider adding user authentication for public use
- Be careful what you send!

### Dependencies

Make sure you have:
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Windows (for building .exe)

---

## Troubleshooting

See `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps.

Common issues:
- **Bot won't start**: Check `.env` has valid Discord token
- **Client won't connect**: Verify server is running and URL is correct
- **Overlay doesn't show**: Check system tray connection status
- **Build fails**: Run `npm install` first

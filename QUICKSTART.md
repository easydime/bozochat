## Common Issues

### "No clients connected"

- Clients need to be running and showing "Connected" in tray
- Check server URL in client settings
- Try `ws://localhost:3001` on same PC as server

### "Can't connect to server"

- Is the server running?
- Is the URL correct? Must start with `ws://`
- Firewall blocking port 3001?
- Try turning off Windows Firewall temporarily to test

### "Bot not responding in Discord"

- Check `.env` has correct token
- Bot invited to server?
- Server console showing errors?
- Restart `start-bot.bat`

### "Overlay doesn't appear"

- Is client connected? (check tray icon)
- Try "Test Notification" from tray menu
- Check overlay position in settings
- May be behind fullscreen apps

## Tips

- Keep the server running on one PC (or use a VPS)
- Clients can be on/off anytime
- `/send` works even if only 1 client connected
- Duration: 1-30 seconds
- Supports: JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, WEBM
- Click overlay or press ESC to dismiss early
